## Jester

The Jester is a neutral role that wins the game if they are voted out (exiled) by the other players.

## Executioner

The Executioner is a neutral role that wins the game if their target is voted out (exiled) by the other players. (If the Executioner's target dies before they get exiled, the executioner becomes an Amnesiac.)

## Arsonist

The Arsonist is a Neutral role with two abilities: dousing players with gasoline and igniting them later. To win, the Arsonist must be the last killer standing.

## Sheriff

The Sheriff is a crewmate role that can kill Impostors. However, if the Sheriff kills a Crewmate, the Sheriff dies instead.

## Snitch

The Snitch is a crewmate role. If the snitch completes all their tasks, the Impostors's names will turn red for them.

## Janitor

The Janitor is an impostor role that can clean up bodies.

## Captain

The Captain is a modifier that grants the ability to call an emergency meeting from anywhere on the map, without needing to be at the emergency button.

## Guesser

The Guesser is a modifier for Impostors that grants the ability to guess a player's role and kill them, however if the guesser's guess is wrong the guesser will die instead.

## Amnesiac

The Amnesiac is a neutral role without a win condition. 
They are roleless.
However, they can remember a role by finding a dead player.
Once they remember their role, they go on to try win with their new win condition.
